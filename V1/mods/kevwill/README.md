#### Summary

I remixed a few parts from toastfr35's KhordUino badminton stringing machine to fit my specific needs:

1.  PSU Box 1 (PSU_Box_1) and Box 2 (PSU_Box_2): I added a cutout for a C13 socket and switch, and modified the vent holes to fit my PSU.
2.  Control Panel Body (CP_body): I modified the external holes to accommodate my wiring and changed the interior mounting posts to fit the Arduino Nano breakout board, buck converter, and terminal block that I used in my build.
3.  Working disc base segment (WD_base_segment): I combined two working disc base segments into one piece to make assembly easier.
4.  Tool drawer (Drawer) and rail (Drawer_rail): I modified the drawer and rail so that the drawer latches closed, preventing the drawer from sliding open and spilling tools during transport.

Here are the specific parts I ordered that fit these modifications:
