# Khorduino V2

## Goals

- Lower BOM cost.
- Fewer different parts to assemble.
- Use standard (still cheap) load cell.
- Easier wiring.
- Lighter, smaller.
- Simplified stringing operation.

## Difference with V1

- More compact (base board length and width reduced to minimum).
- Fewer (larger) 3D printed parts.
- Fewer bolts and nuts
- Fewer different sizes of bolts and nuts.
- No linear bearings.
- Different load cell (and placement of).
- Battery powered (via adapters, e.g. Ryobi 18V battery).
- Single limit switch (other limit enforce in software).
- A single 3 positions switch for stringing operation (pull, idle, release).
- No LCD. Instead Bluetooth + Android/IOS App for settings.
- Slightly longer legs for a bit more clearance.
- Buzzer to indicate desired tansion is reached.


## What will be the same

The general design remains the same.

- NEMA23 stepper motor (required for the needed torque).
- Large bearing to access the racquet face from top and bottom.
